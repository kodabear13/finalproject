    <h3> About Me </h3>
  <p id="para4"> My name is Najid Smith and my buisness is about helping people who are don’t have a hand or leg to be able to have one. They will be able to function as if they didn’t have a prosthetic. I created this company because I always want to help people. Helping people who need prosthetics is one way to help. Most prosthetics are very expensive and people can’t afford them. Mine are going to be affordable for any and everyone. This is my way of helping others.</p> <br>
